I view my [personal token](./whitepaper.md) as an instrument that helps me collaborate and connect with others, while helping me be grounded in reality.

I intend to share equity in my token to incentivize collaboration at the level of my life - beyond any single idea - to amplify my efforts across everything i will ever do.

My personal token's liquidity pool is an opportunity to receive feedback from the right people, including those who may disagree with me. I intend to create a curated community of people whose feedback I deeply respect, who can trade shares of my token freely amongst themselves.

The personal token is a primitive, a foundation for a much better system that incentivizes positive-sum collaboration over zero-sum competition. I intend to dedicate myself towards building this system. 

I need help to launch my token. I want:
1. Feedback on the personal token [whitepaper](../whitepaper.md).
2. (Legal) Help writing the legal agreement, and ensuring compliance.
3. (Technical) Help implementing the personal token onchain.
4. (Storytelling) Help presenting my personal token in a powerful way.

Will share equity with those who can help me implement my token.
