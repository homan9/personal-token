### Launching my token

I intend to share equity in my [personal token](../whitepaper.md) to incentivize collaboration at the level of my life - beyond any single idea - to amplify my efforts across everything i will ever do.

I intend to create a curated community of people whose feedback I deeply respect, who can trade shares of my token freely amongst themselves.

The personal token is a primitive, a foundation for a much better system that incentivizes positive-sum collaboration over zero-sum competition. I intend to dedicate myself towards building this system. 

Help me launch my token:

1. Feedback on the [whitepaper](../whitepaper.md).
2. (Legal) Help crafting the legal agreement.
3. (Technical) Help building the personal token onchain.
4. (Storytelling) Help presenting my personal token.

Will share equity with those who can help.
