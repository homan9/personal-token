## Joining

By joining the village, you are becoming a member of the group that can trade shares of my personal token.

**What this means.** You are whitelisted to trade shares within the village, subject to your cap. Joining the village does not grant you shares — it grants you the ability to participate.

**Identity.** I need to know who you are. Your display name will be visible on the site. Your legal name will not be shared publicly, but I need it since this instrument operates in a legal space. You must notify me of any changes to your legal name.

**Act on your own.** You are acting on your own behalf, not as a proxy or nominee for any third party.

**Evolution.** The village must evolve. If we part ways, any shares you hold will be bought back according to the onchain buyback function.

**Visibility.** Your membership in the village and any trading activity is public and visible onchain.
