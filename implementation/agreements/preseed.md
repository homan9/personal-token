## Preseed Round Agreement

By participating in the preseed round, you are contributing capital to my personal token before shares are priced.

**What you're contributing.** A capital amount of your choosing, subject to the preseed cap.

**What you'll receive.** When the seed round takes place and sets a price per share, your contribution will convert into shares at that price, minus a discount. The discount is applied on a curve — higher for the first dollar in, lower for the last — to reflect that early capital is worth more than later capital. The discount curve is defined onchain and visible to everyone.

**When you'll receive shares.** Shares are issued at the seed round. There is no guaranteed timeline for when the seed round will happen.

**What happens to your capital.** I need it to get this off the ground — legal fees, infrastructure, and whatever else is required to reach the seed round. No refunds.

**Risk.** This is an experiment in uncharted territory. Only participate with capital you are genuinely comfortable putting at risk.

**Identity.** You must be a member of the village to participate. You are acting on your own behalf, not as a proxy or nominee for any third party.
